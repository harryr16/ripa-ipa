    <h1>Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (<abbr title="Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act">RIPA</abbr> 2000) </h1>
    
    <p>The <abbr title="Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act">RIPA</abbr> law provides an authorisation law covering communications and data. The RIPA was carried out to give public authorities legal framework when carrying out surveillance. this act gives police and other legal departments the authority to:  </p>

    <ul><li>demand ISP's to provide accces to a customer's communications and data.</li><li>allow them monitor someone's internet activity</li><li>preventation of such activies getting revealed in court</li></ul>

    <h2>What are the key principles of RIPA?</h2>

    <p>As a main principle RIPA governs active surveillance, accesing private information about a person which would normally be considered illegal if carried out by a private individual, however its considered legal since the authorities use this to catch potential crime.</p>

    <h2>What's the difference between directed and intrusive surveillance?</h2>

    <p>Directed surveillance is carried out in very specific investigations to detect or prevent a crime, likely to result in gaining the private information of a 1 or 2 individuals. However intrusive surveillence would involve a : private vehicle, residential block or a surveillence device.For example if you were to plant a bug in an individuals house, that would be "intrusive" surveillence, but if you were to tail a specific person that would be "directed" surveillance. </p>

    <h1>Investigatory Powers Act (<abbr title="Investigatory Powers Act">IPA</abbr> 2016)</h1>

    <h2>What is the difference between RIPA (2000) and IPA (2016)</h2>

    <p>The IPA has updated and evolved parts of RIPA. The IPA has given law enforcemnt and local authorities updated power to gain access to peoples personal communications and data for legal reasons. Furthermore IPA has allowed alot more authorities access to private communications and data without a warrant. It also introduces a 'double-lock' for interception warrants, so that, following Secretary of State authorisation, these (and other warrants) cannot come into force until they have been approved by a judge. And it creates a powerful new Investigatory Powers Commissioner to oversee how these powers are used.</p>
    
    <h2>Is IPA (2016) good?</h2>
    
    <p>The IPA 2016 has had a positive impact on wider society as the introduction of Investigatory Powers Commissioners Office (IPCO) has streamlined the applicable oversight regime, consolidating it under one body and providing further accountability and transparency for the use of investigatory powers.</p>
